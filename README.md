# ExmoArchiveBot
As of right now, it periodically archives stuff from /r/exmormon.

These threads talk about the updates:
1st - https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/3r4rke/im_making_a_bot_that_will_help_prevent_losing/
2nd - https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/3txao1/exmoarchivebot_v2/

The .log and .txt files from v1 are no longer needed in v2.
